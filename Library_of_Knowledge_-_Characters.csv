MR,Ellshra,"Ellshra is a very valuable MR
She got very low HP, very high mag and decent agi.

Time Mage main offers access to Comet and Meteor as strong none elemental atk, as well as Quicken.

Time mage sub only really offers Haste or maybe transposition for manual play, might have some use depending on usage. 

Rune Knight sub gives her access to two hard hitting slash atk, a magic lifedrain that gives her a mag buff for one turn and a 3 turn mag buff that reduces her own hp. This is her best sub if you plan to play her as DPS. 

White Mage sub offers Protect/Shell to support her allies and Curada/Curaga for some healing. The best option if played as Support. 

Her big problem is her terrible base HP and her base res, she dies to almost everything in one hit and rune knights skills reducing her own HP doesnt improve that.

She can be played for quicken in Live PvP, as Healer Support with White Mage or as DPS with Rune Knight. She doesnt offer anything special for most PvE Content. ","Sub: White mage (Support / Rune Knight (DPS) / Time mage in rare cases

UR,Rhaldor,"Rhaldor is fairly underwhelming Unit
He got High base HP and atk as well as good agi

His new Main Job Pugilist offers a teleport, a low range human killer skill and a skill that gets more damage if he got hit more than 5 times, as well as a max hp/def buff for him self and a aoe strike atk/defpen for self buff. His kit is mostly Melee and either single target or very low area which makes it hard for him to be used effective.

His Pugilist sub offers a small self heal and a low range atk break that looses effectiveness if he got hit more than 5 times. This sub is very weak and only for Content like Porcelain tower useful since it got a selfheal.

Paladin sub offers the most useful additions to his kit, a physical barrier, a second damage type as well as taunting blade which allows him to be abl to be played as tank. recommended (if not used as main tank disable taunting blade)

Thief sub gives him the option to be played for Steal time, but other units do the job better than him.

His main Issue is his very limited range and AP sustain. He is also weak to magic damage.

He can be played in Bruiser comb or as Tank is most hybrid combs. His limited range and no aoe make are bad for PvE aswell, but hes still usable in most Content.","Sub: Paladin

MR,Ahlim,"Ahlim is one of the better MR units 
She got good base HP and agi, but fairly low atk for a main dps.
Dragoon as main job offers the usual long range jump attacks and a strong atk buff.
Her main sub gives a bravery decrease and a jump/move buff which may got a use in PvE but super niche usage and almost never recommended to use

Assassin sub gives her the possibility to be played as Mug bot other than that the skills are super low range and don't help her much unless you desperatly need slash damage.

Dual Gunner is her best sub giving her a second damage type to work with aswell as some good aoes and an additional defpen buff. 

Her big problems are very heavy AP problems if not played with Xiza bells, aswell as her low atk and base res.

In PvP she can be played in Bruiser and Pierce combs as sub dps. For PvE she is usable in most content.","Sub: Dual Gunner

UR,Sakura,"Sakura is an amazing Mage
She got for a mage good hp, high mag and decet agi. 
She combines Light and lightning damage in her kit and can reduce the enemys resistance to those elements, aswell as buff her own and allies resistance to those aswell as dark. She got multiple diamond aoes and overall a very high range on her skills. Her sub offers support with Shell and protect if needed.

Red mage as sub gives her mostly Cura and Sleep as useful additions to her kit, which are mainly good in manual play = Porcelain Tower and Live PvP

Kotodama Wielder on the other side will be her strongest and most versatile sub, she gets a good magic atk and spirit pen buff aswell as a 100% hit skill and a stun which gives her a lot more options. 

Her big downsides are very mediocre base res values and no access to cast time reduction other than her own TMR.

Her limit is a high range, hard hitting diamond aoe with dark killer which is very strong, but got high ap cost. 

She fits well in any magic or light comb and even got her use in Lightning combs. ","Sub: Kotodama Wielder

MR,Livialle,"Livialle is a fairly strong MR
She got fairly low hp, decent mag and very low agi.
She got access to very strong magic attacks as Blackmage main like Earthga and Flare.
Blackmage sub gives access to Drain and sleep which are pretty strong skills, but they are usally not worth picking over Arith sub. 

Cleric is a super weak sub job, it can have its use in some PvE content like Porcelain Tower since it offers status removal, some minor healing and a light attack with Banish

Arithmetician is by far her best sub job height- cure and cura in buffed by her MA give her very strong instant healing and level stonera a strong instant diamond aoe, since she don't got access to level stonega she is a lot weaker than normal Ariths 

Her big downside are the terrible base res and base tankyness as Blackmage, aswell as no cast time reduction for her Blackmage skills

With her low base tankyness and high cast time as Blackmage she is fairly weak in PvP, but got some use in Magic combs or as main healer. She is very strong in most PvE content.","Sub: Arithmetician

UR,Niv'Lu,"Niv'Lu is currently the best Missle unit
She got low hp, decent atk and very high agi
She combines high range, utility and damage in one kit
As Sniper Main she got a lot of utility, she can reduce agi, break physical barriers, and remove hate and gets a buff for extra def pen and range. She can potentially be played in evasion combs since she got high agi and luck. 

Gunner sub gives her some additional buffs like missle atk and crit rate and extra status inflictions like blind and immobilize

Time mage gives her acces to haste and quicken which is mainly good in manual PvP but also got its use in auto

Her biggest downside is AP problems if shes not used with Xiza Bell.  

Her limit is a high range Diamon aoe that reduces def by a large amount for 3 turn, its a very deadly skill. 

She is very versatile in her playstyle she plays well in Gunner combs, evasion combs, lightning combs or even as sub dps in most mixed damage physical teams. ","Sub: recommended Gunner, but any are usable

UR,Duane,"Duane is a very versatile Unit
His Unique job can inflict Disable, reduce dark res and remove reraise, he also got a def/spr buff which gives him some extra tankyness, his slash buff even tho its fairly strong is usally recommended to be disable since his ai works very weird with it, best to test it out since its usage depends on team comb and map.
His main sub gives atk and mag break skills which are decent but niche in its usage compared to its other subs. 

Viking sub gives him the very cheap very strong Launch and devastating Killing axe aswell as a def/atk buff which works very well with his main kit. 

Dragoon sub offers a second damage type, a strong atk buff and very high range jump attacks. recommended if used with Kain.

Duanes limit got good range, cross aoe which a lifedrain effect, very valueable for his kit, but high ap cost. 

He fits well in any slash or dark comb, he is strong in Bruiser combs and can also be played in pierce combs or hybrid combs with units like Dragoon sub Lasswell.","Sub: recommended Viking, but every sub got its use

MR,Tyytas,"Tyytas is a very niche Tank. 
He got extremly low atk and agi, but good base hp.
Paladin main gives him a decent hp and def base and strong buffs like immortal spirit and saintly wall.
His sub job is a must have since it gives access to Taunting blade and with that hate generation.
Thanks to his MA and access to AP UP he can use first turn taunting Blade.

Red Mage sub other than the passiv offers nothing he needs, he got way to low magic to make use of this skills, might have some very very niche use in PvE with sleep/esuna and resistance break

Viking also offers nothing to support his usage, he gets an atk buff, a decent atk skill and a drain atk, which might have some use in PvE but he has way to low atk and no defpen to make use of this damage based sub.

His big downside is his big upside, his base res values, He got very high pierce and Missle res,but extremly low slash and magic res which makes his usage very niche. He is also super slow

His only role is to be played as a tank against pure missle/pierce combs, but he fills this niche extremly well. ","Sub: Paladin

She got good base hp, fairly low mag and decent agi. 
as Spellblade main shes build to be a magic tank, with good base magic res and buffs to decrease magic damage, but she gets outclassed by Rain, Agrias or even Fryevia in that role.
Spellblade sub gives her a aoe magic res buff and access to taunting spell which is required if you use her as tank.

Arithmetician sub gives her some very strong spells with level banishra and banishga and some very minor healing with height cure, this sub is usally recommended for any content shes not supposed to be the tank in.

Thief sub is a physical class an offers very little to support her kit, its possible to play her as Mug bot which is the only real use for this sub. 

Her big downside she got very underwhelming base res as a supposed to be tank class and too little mag to be played as dps 

She got some niche use in PvP as magic tank, but as I mentioned already outclassed by many other options, for PvE she got the Mug bot use and some fast clearing for easy Map in MP with Arith sub. ","Sub: Spellblade / Arithmetician

As Ranger main she got high range a strong diamond aoe with Barrage and some weak status effects with immobilize and poison.
Ranger sub gives her a weak 1 turn evasion buff which is only to gain extra ap and the 100% hit skill Sharpshoot.

Viking sub offers only the atk/def buff to support her, the atk skills are too low range to make use of them.

Knight sub is just bad for her, melee atk skills with low damage, the debuffs might be decent but doesnt offer enough to use this sub ever.

Her big downside is very low damage for a mainly dps class and very bad base resistance, she does no damage and dies to almost everything in one hit.

Time mage sub is what makes her good, it offers haste and Quicken which is the main reason to use her.

Thief sub offers the passiv as very strong tool and you may get use from steal time and steal heart, but that is very niche.

Dual Gunner main offers a bunch of high range attacks as well as a strong buff which gives defpen for herself and missle attack to herself aswell as allies.

Gunner sub gives her access to valuable status effects as well as a aoe crit buff, this is her recommended sub.

Soldier sub offers a bunch of slash atks which are mostly melee and offer nearly nothing to support her, might have some value just for the atk buff. 

Her big downsides are as for most units AP problems, she also got very low hp and with Self sacrifice bad base res. Also her reactive skills are very lackluster.

Her Limit is a low range, hard hitting skill that decreased agi, its a fairly weak limit compared to other units.

Viking offers another atk buff and some Slash atks for a second damage type, best PvE sub.

She got low HP, low atk, decent mag and decent agi

Her Unique main White Mage of Baron is in a weird spot she got high magic but most of her skills are physical.
The Main kit offers a similar skill to Curada, a aoe skill that negates several status effect, holy, a stronger more expensive version of Sharpshoot and a missle skill that reduces ice res. Overall a pretty strong kit, but her missle skills are super weak do to her low atk stat.

Her Baron sub offers a silence and a weak missle aoe, unless you REALLY need the silence, don't use this sub.

White mage is by far her best sub it offers shell, Protect, Curada and Curaga for additional healing/support. Sadly she didnt got access to Full life which would've made her much stronger. This sub is recommended for most Content.

Black Mage sub gives her additional fire power with all 3 versions of Blizzard, sleep and Drain, since she got no access to Cast time reduction Black mage is fairly weak in most PvP situations. 

Her Limit is a very strong heal in a square aoe around herself that gives AP for allies, a very strong limit but the range limits its use. 

Her big weakness are her low atk stat which weakens her missle atks by a lot and no access to cast time reduction which limits the strengh of her magic skills. Additionally she got low HP and overall weak base res. 

She can be played as main healer or sub dps in most teams, but looses to several other units like Ayaka/Ildyra/HLeela who play a similar role, her main benefit over those units is the physical missle damage she can offer. ","Sub: White Mage

His Main kit offers a attack that raises his own agi, a disable and a high range aoe that breaks atk, he got sdef/spr buff can can apply a physical barrier for allies but reduces his own HP. 

His Lunar sub offers a Max hp buff, a reaper killer atk and a magic barrier for allies in exchange for his own hp, This sub is only used if you have need for the magic barrier.

Soldier sub offers a strong atk buff, and several strong atk skills, but most of them reduce his hp which can make him very fragile. Usally recommended if used properly.

Monk sub offers a very strong 1 turn atk buff and several fist abilitys giving him a second damage type. Recommended if you are scared he kills himself with Soldier sub. 

His limit is a 3 range single target stun. Pretty weak for a limit. 

His main weakness is that most of his good skills reduce his Hp which makes him hard to play, hes missing def pen and hes weak to missle & magic.

Time Mage sub offers none elemental Comet as well as Haste and Quicken to support his allies. Its the best option if you wanna keep him in the back line or need additional support. 

His limit is a 3-hit diamond aoe that can paralyze a potentially very strong Limit.

Arith sub offers a height 3 Disable, a level 4 watera and a CT average. the multiple of height and Level can be changed with her passivs. 

Spellblade sub offers offers several water slash atks, a magic res buff and the ability to generate hate which is not recommended, This sub is recommended but only for the magic res buff.

Black Mage sub offer Drain, Sleep, Water and Watera, since she got no cast time reduction at all stronger version in her main kit this sub is bad for her. 

Her Limit increases the CT of herself and Allies in the radius increased in effectiveness if the targets level is multiple of 3. This limit is almost only good if shes the last unit to move and usally recommended to be disable. Its difficult to use effective.

Red mage sub offer Cura, sleep and Jamming thrust and just for Jamming Thrust this is his most valuable sub job. 

White Mage offers Protect/Shell for some support and Curada/Curaga for healing, since hes mostly a Main dps Jamming thrust is hard to skip, but if you need extra support or want him to stay in the backline white mage might be worth picking up. 

His Limit decreases Wind res on a single target, decent for raid, but Jamming thrust offers more range and Hazard Slash ore damage.
